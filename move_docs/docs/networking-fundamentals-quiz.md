## Answer Key

1. **a) Internet Protocol** - IP stands for Internet Protocol, the fundamental protocol for internet communication.

2. **b) 192.168.1.1** - This is a valid IPv4 address. IPv4 addresses have four octets, each ranging from 0-255.

3. **c) 255.255.255.0** - Class C networks use a /24 subnet mask, which is 255.255.255.0.

4. **c) 80** - HTTP traffic typically uses port 80.

5. **a) Domain Name System** - DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.

6. **c) Network Layer** - Layer 3 (Network Layer) is responsible for routing packets between networks.

7. **a) 254** - A /24 subnet has 256 total addresses, minus 2 (network and broadcast) = 254 usable host addresses.

8. **b) DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically assigns IP addresses.

9. **b) 127.0.0.1** - This is the standard loopback address.

10. **c) Switch** - Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) using MAC addresses.

11. **a) Media Access Control** - MAC addresses are unique identifiers for network interfaces.

12. **b) 443** - HTTPS (secure HTTP) typically uses port 443.

13. **b) To determine network and host portions of an IP address** - Subnet masks separate the network and host portions.

14. **b) 192.168.0.0/16** - This is one of the RFC 1918 private address ranges.

15. **a) Transmission Control Protocol** - TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.

16. **b) ping** - The ping command tests network connectivity using ICMP.

17. **c) 7** - The OSI model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.

18. **b) TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless** - This is the primary difference between the two protocols.

19. **c) Router** - Routers connect different networks and route traffic between them.

20. **a) Internet Control Message Protocol** - ICMP is used for network diagnostics and error reporting.

21. **a) 20** - FTP uses port 21 for control and port 20 for data transfer.

22. **d) 192.168.1.255** - The broadcast address is the last address in the subnet range.

23. **b) SSH** - Secure Shell provides encrypted remote access.

24. **a) Address Resolution Protocol** - ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

25. **c) 192.168.1.1** - This is an IPv4 address, not IPv6. IPv6 uses hexadecimal notation.

26. **a) 64 bytes minimum, 1518 bytes maximum** - Standard Ethernet frame sizes.

27. **c) Star topology** - In star topology, all devices connect to a central point.

28. **a) Virtual Local Area Network** - VLANs create logical network segments.

29. **b) POP3** - Post Office Protocol version 3 is used for email retrieval (IMAP is also common).

30. **b) To translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses** - NAT allows multiple private addresses to share public IP addresses.
