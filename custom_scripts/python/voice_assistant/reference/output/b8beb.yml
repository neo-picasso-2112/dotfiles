    The meaning of life is one of humanity''s most enduring questions. Different philosophical
    traditions offer various perspectives:


    **Purpose-driven views**: Life gains meaning through pursuing goals, creating
    value, or fulfilling a divine purpose. This could mean contributing to society,
    raising a family, or following religious teachings.


    **Existentialist perspective**: We create our own meaning through choices and
    actions. Life has no inherent meaning, but we give it meaning by how we live.


    **Happiness and flourishing**: Some argue life''s meaning comes from maximizing
    wellbeing - both our own and others''. This includes love, friendship, and personal
    growth.


    **Connection and relationships**: Many find meaning through deep connections with
    others, being part of something larger than themselves.


    Ultimately, the meaning of life might be deeply personal - what gives your life
    meaning may differ from what gives mine meaning. The search itself, and how we
    choose to live while searching, may be as important as any answer we find.
